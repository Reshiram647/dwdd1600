                <p>At its heart story writting is very very very crazy. Youre always thinking about how when where and why things are happening,<br> if its too orignal or not original enough, and if people will even care or like what you write. All of this can matter or... <strong>maybe it doesnt have to be</strong>?<br> Who says you cant write things just for yourself and a few others, instead of sharing with a judgmental world share it with friends and family.<br> And maybe one day your work will reach the stands.</p>
    
                <h2>Reasons to Write</h2>
                    <ul>

                        <li>Create a New world to Escape to</li>
                    </ul>

                 <h2>What This Page is For</h2>
