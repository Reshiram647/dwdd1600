            <h1>Brainstorming</h1>
               <p>Brainstorming can be hard. Sometimes it's really easy and we know what we want and what we want to happen. But sometimes we really just can't think of anything. It's either too odd or too much like something you've seen somewhere else. Then there's the beauty of brainstorming, the whole point is to come up with ideas. <strong>Remember there are no bad ideasâ€¦yet.</strong> In this stage we are just getting any ideas we can later we continue to sort through and find the best idea. This idea doesn't always have to stay the same, you can change it as much as you want. Say your original idea was to use romance and have a love interest. Maybe instead of having a slow burn add complications not necessarily cheating there are tons of things that break people up. And then maybe change it again. That's what this stage is for to find a sort of plan for your story,  just a rough very rough draft.

                <h2>Enviornment</h2>
                    <p>	Sometimes your environment may be why you can't find anything. Maybe you're stuck in a cubicle, stressed and worried about next month's rent or have a bad family situation. Changing your environment to something that <strong>relaxes</strong> you can really help. For me being out in nature is amazing. The trees, leaves , grass and scenery calm me down so much that ideas start coming to mind. Also remember this story doesn't necessarily have a deadline (hopefully) you can take as much time as you need to gather and find ideas.</p>

                    <h2>Adventure</h2>
                    <p>	It's amazing to go out and experience the world where so many ideas come from. You look at popular stories and see that they've been based on events in history or events in people's lives. <strong>Going to do something</strong> like skating or driving building could also help you come up with amazing ideas. Maybe you've had a vacation recently, think of the things you did on said vacation and that could give you some ideas, or think of other people in your life and their experiences seeing if that could work for you.</p>
